Join:
Inner-Join-
- joins two tables based on the 'ON' clause, which specifies a common column

Left-Join- 
- selects data from the left table and matches it to a row in the right table based on the 'ON' clause

Cross-Join-
- creates all possible combinations of rows

Left join could potentially be useful to email an author the story, or the changes they made to a story by linking the story table and the users table. 
We could also send an email to a page creator every time an author added to their story.

Article "Programming Sucks" was very humorous and well written. It feels relatable, even though we don't have real jobs. 
Concrete actions:
- always maintain communications about changes made to code, even if it's on your own individual code part, to prevent errors and merge conflicts
- use many comments to explain code 
- follow proper coding conventions
